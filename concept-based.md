# Concept-Based methods

## How ? 
1. 
- Concept activation vectors (CAVs) are computed by supervised training of a linear classifier based on labeled concepts.
- CAVs are used to compute directional derivatives that measures the sensitivity of predictions to these vectors, 
        i.e., to measure the importance of a concept with respect to a specific class.
